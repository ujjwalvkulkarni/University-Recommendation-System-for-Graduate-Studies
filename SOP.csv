21634,9,"""Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."" - Abraham Lincoln 
'AlphaGo' is trending now, Netflix notified me and I was onto it in a flash. I knew as much about Go as the Alpha-Go knew about it, before being trained. After being trained, it created history by beating the world champion of Go. This anecdote boasts the abilities computer science has equipped us with. Computer Science is a go-to toolbox for humans, to repair and to prepare. I want to be of service and contribute to society with the tools I possess. But as the above proverb by Abraham Lincoln expresses, I need to hone my tools before I can put it to use. Hence, a master's degree in computer science is the whetstone I seek. 
As a child, playing EA Cricket on the computer was my favorite pastime. One day, my elder brother, with whom I played the game, had coded a software patch to maximize the attributes of every player. It was not the game with overpowered players that intrigued me, but the process behind it. I did not understand the logic until 9th grade, when I encountered Java for the first time, as a part of the curriculum. The fact that I would be able to decipher the reason behind the overpowered players enthralled me. My zeal led to the creation of my first project, a pizzeria billing system. It was comprehensive enough to give 13-year-old me the confidence to pursue a degree in this field. 
10th-grade results were declared, and I scored 91.8%. I, an aspiring software developer, wanted to achieve my goals by getting accepted to one of the Indian Institute of Technologies (IIT). Regrettably, the 10th-grade success got the better of my sanity, and this complacency reflected in my 12th-grade result. I scored a mere 71.8%, which wrecked my chances of gaining admission to the IITs. The plummet of 20% was dispiriting, but it cleared the fuzzy line between confidence and overconfidence for me. 
Nonetheless, my ardor for Computer Sciences inspired me to apply for a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology. But, I did not meet the requirements of the Computer Science department. However, I got accepted by the Software Engineering department, which I sensed as an opportunity to pursue my purpose. These 3.5 years of software-oriented curriculum have been conducive to shape my mind as a complete software developer. 
As mentioned earlier, computer science is a toolbox comprising of various tools, with each instrument having the potential to unlock different possibilities. I desired to learn how each of these tools worked. Hence, after my freshman year, I interned at DSPWorks India, an Internet of Things based company. My responsibilities were to enhance the efficiency of gateways keeping the economic aspects in mind. After researching and probing gateways on different microcontrollers, I developed a Long Range gateway on Raspberry Pi, which to my understanding, worked the best. 
Just after the commencement of the sophomore year, I was mentored by Dr. Sameer Mathur from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Lucknow on Data Analytics, having managerial applications. I analyzed the distribution of several datasets using R-programming. Additionally, I reviewed 3 case studies from Harvard Business School, which augmented my analytical skills and decision-making abilities. This experience kindled my interest in data science. It inspired me to take Data Science (15IT423E) and Data Mining (15CS331E) as electives in undergraduate school. 
A foundation in data science, along with the Alpha-Go experience, gave me the drive to pursue Machine Learning. Having a solid foundation in Calculus and Statistics, I started with the Machine Learning course on Coursera. Consequently, I read research papers and put the open course wares to my use. My understanding and engagement in the field grew, which helped me secure scholarships from Facebook and Bertlesmann on Udacity. I have implemented various regression and classification algorithms in my projects. I also have a good understanding of the Deep Learning frameworks, PyTorch, Keras, and Tensorflow. For every problem, I believe computer science has a solution. 
In junior year, I faced a common problem, shortlisting colleges to pursue a master's degree. I used various websites to mitigate this ambiguity. But, I recognized these websites used only the quantifiable features of the application, to recommend universities. They failed to identify the importance of a Statement of Purpose (SoP). Thus, I decided to take this as my Major Project problem statement. ETS uses e-rater, a software to rate the essays in the analytical section of the GRE. I intend to use a similar Natural Language Processing approach to score the SoPs in my project. Using a collaborative filtering algorithm, the score of the SoP, along with other features, will be used to recommend universities to the user. 
My keen interest in Artificial Intelligence led me to open a Special Interest Group for Artificial Intelligence (SIGAI), ACM Chapter in the college. I dispensed the duties of a Vice-Chair. The main focus of this chapter was to spread awareness about Artificial Intelligence and provide a platform for young minds to showcase their talents and connect with other like-minded students. I mentored more than 60 freshers and helped them get started in this field. We secured funding of 2000 euros from the SIGAI-AAF-2019 (SIGAI AI Activity Funding) for our proposal, which was to organize an event. The event included introducing underprivileged students with Artificial Intelligence and providing them with the necessary skills which can get them begun in the field. I was also a member of the National Social Service scheme in my freshman year. An organization where I campaigned about fire safety and the importance of a helmet. Social service has al ways been of great value to me, and I intend to use the skills I acquire for the betterment of society. 
I get excited whenever I picture myself being a part of New York University's multicultured environment. The flexible master's in Computer Science will help me deepen my knowledge in the area of my interest. Based on my experiences, I have developed a strong liking for Artificial Intelligence. Hence, I would like to be a part of the Artificial Intelligence Now Institute. It is one of the most important motivators for me to apply to New York University. Being able to be a part of the lab and research with proficient students and accomplished faculty is once in a lifetime opportunity. All these factors have left me yearning to be part of New York University. My Curriculum Vitae lacks a research paper because I always felt I should gain more knowledge before working on a research idea. Now, I am confident enough to pursue research and what better place than New York University to be able to do it. 
I am sure to acclimatize and blend in with the environment effortlessly. I have a strong belief in my potentials and am confident of amassing different skills that this program would offer. Therefore, I feel New York University is the perfect whetstone to my axe.
